# Fundamental Analysis

This skill evaluates the intrinsic value of equities and crypto assets by analyzing financial statements, valuation ratios, tokenomics, macroeconomic context, and protocol-level metrics. It answers the question: "Is this asset cheap, fairly priced, or expensive relative to its fundamentals?" Fundamental analysis provides the conviction layer — technical analysis times the entry, but fundamentals determine whether the asset is worth owning at all.

## When to Use This Skill
- When evaluating whether to invest in a stock or crypto asset
- When comparing multiple assets in the same sector or category
- Before earnings announcements to assess expected impact
- When analyzing tokenomics of a new crypto project
- When assessing macro conditions that affect portfolio allocation
- When building a DCF or relative valuation model
- When evaluating protocol revenue and usage metrics for DeFi tokens
- When deciding sector allocation based on macro environment
- When a position has moved significantly and you need to reassess fair value

## What This Skill Does
- **Equity Valuation**: Calculates P/E, P/S, P/B, PEG, EV/EBITDA, and DCF fair value estimates
- **Crypto Fundamental Assessment**: Analyzes tokenomics, protocol revenue, active users, developer activity, and governance
- **Macro Context Analysis**: Evaluates interest rates, inflation, USD strength, and yield curve impact on asset classes
- **Sector Analysis**: Determines how different sectors respond to current macro regime
- **Earnings Analysis**: Assesses EPS beats/misses, revenue growth trends, guidance quality, and forward estimates
- **Comparable Analysis**: Ranks assets against sector peers using standardized metrics
- **Valuation Verdict**: Produces an undervalued/fair/overvalued rating with confidence level and price target range

## Methodology

### Step 1: Asset Classification and Framework Selection

Before running any numbers, classify the asset to determine which valuation framework applies:

```
ASSET TYPE ROUTING

Equity (stock)
  ├── Growth stock (revenue growth >20% YoY) → P/S, PEG, DCF with high growth assumptions
  ├── Value stock (P/E < sector median, low growth) → P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA, dividend yield
  ├── GARP (growth at reasonable price) → PEG, EV/EBITDA, DCF
  └── Pre-profit / IPO → P/S, revenue multiple, TAM analysis

Crypto
  ├── L1 blockchain (ETH, SOL, AVAX) → FDV/Revenue, active addresses, dev activity, fee revenue
  ├── DeFi protocol (AAVE, UNI, MKR) → P/F ratio, TVL, revenue/fees, token buybacks
  ├── Infrastructure (LINK, GRT, FIL) → Usage metrics, integration count, revenue
  └── Meme / community token → NOT suitable for fundamental analysis (see memecoin-trading)
```

---

### Step 2: Equity Valuation Ratios

Calculate and interpret the core valuation multiples:

#### Price-to-Earnings (P/E)
```
P/E = Share Price / Earnings Per Share (EPS)
Forward P/E = Share Price / Estimated Next-12-Month EPS

Interpretation:
  P/E < 10    → Potentially undervalued OR earnings declining
  P/E 10-20   → Fair range for mature companies
  P/E 20-40   → Growth premium — justified only if growth supports it
  P/E > 40    → Expensive — needs exceptional growth to justify
  P/E negative → Unprofitable — use P/S instead

CRITICAL: Always compare P/E to:
  1. Company's own 5-year average P/E
  2. Sector median P/E
  3. Growth rate (via PEG ratio)
```

#### Price-to-Sales (P/S)
```
P/S = Market Cap / Annual Revenue
EV/Revenue = Enterprise Value / Annual Revenue

Useful when: Company is unprofitable or has volatile earnings

Interpretation by sector:
  SaaS / cloud software:   3-15x revenue (high gross margins justify premium)
  Hardware / manufacturing: 0.5-3x revenue
  Retail / e-commerce:      0.5-2x revenue
  Biotech (pre-revenue):    Based on TAM and pipeline probability
```

#### Price-to-Book (P/B)
```
P/B = Share Price / Book Value Per Share
Book Value = Total Assets - Total Liabilities

Interpretation:
  P/B < 1.0  → Trading below liquidation value — deep value or value trap
  P/B 1-3    → Normal range for most companies
  P/B > 5    → Asset-light business or significant intangibles

Most useful for: Banks, insurance, REITs, asset-heavy businesses
Less useful for: Tech, SaaS, biotech (intangible assets dominate)
```

#### PEG Ratio
```
PEG = P/E / Annual EPS Growth Rate (%)

Example:
  P/E = 30, EPS growth = 25%
  PEG = 30 / 25 = 1.2

Interpretation:
  PEG < 1.0   → Undervalued relative to growth (the sweet spot)
  PEG 1.0-1.5 → Fairly valued
  PEG 1.5-2.0 → Getting expensive
  PEG > 2.0   → Growth premium is stretched

WARNING: PEG is only meaningful when growth is positive and sustainable.
Do NOT use PEG for cyclical companies or one-time growth spikes.
```

#### EV/EBITDA
```
Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash
EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation + Amortization

EV/EBITDA = Enterprise Value / EBITDA

Interpretation by sector:
  Tech:             12-25x (capital-light)
  Industrial:       6-12x
  Energy:           4-8x
  Utilities:        8-12x (stable cash flows)
  Consumer staples: 10-15x

Advantage over P/E: Capital structure-neutral, ignores tax differences
Best for: Comparing companies with different debt levels or in M&A analysis
```

---

### Step 3: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Modeling

DCF is the gold standard for intrinsic value. Build a simplified model:

```
STEP-BY-STEP DCF

1. PROJECT FREE CASH FLOW (FCF) for 5-10 years
   FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures

   Year 1-3: Use analyst consensus or recent growth rate
   Year 4-7: Taper growth toward sector average
   Year 8-10: Taper toward GDP growth rate (2-3%)

2. CALCULATE TERMINAL VALUE
   Terminal Value = FCF_final × (1 + terminal_growth) / (discount_rate - terminal_growth)

   Terminal growth rate: 2-3% (never above long-term GDP growth)

3. DISCOUNT TO PRESENT VALUE
   PV = Σ [FCF_t / (1 + r)^t] + [Terminal Value / (1 + r)^n]

   Discount rate (r):
     WACC for equities (typically 8-12%)
     Higher for crypto (15-25% to reflect risk)

4. CALCULATE PER-SHARE VALUE
   Intrinsic Value = Total PV / Shares Outstanding
   Margin of Safety = (Intrinsic Value - Current Price) / Intrinsic Value

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
  Margin of Safety > 30%  → Strong buy signal
  Margin of Safety 10-30% → Moderate buy signal
  Margin of Safety 0-10%  → Fairly valued, wait for better entry
  Margin of Safety < 0%   → Overvalued, avoid or consider short
```

**Always provide a DCF Sensitivity Table:**

```
Example: NVDA DCF sensitivity (price per share)

                    Terminal Growth Rate
Discount Rate    1.5%     2.0%     2.5%     3.0%
    8%          $185     $210     $245     $295
    9%          $155     $175     $200     $235
   10%          $135     $150     $170     $195
   11%          $118     $130     $148     $168
   12%          $105     $115     $130     $148

Current price: $140 → Fair value at 10% / 2.5% = $170 (18% upside)
```

---

### Step 4: Crypto Fundamental Analysis

Crypto assets require a different framework since most do not have traditional financial statements.

#### Tokenomics Analysis
```
SUPPLY ANALYSIS
  Total Supply:        Maximum tokens that will ever exist
  Circulating Supply:  Tokens currently in circulation
  FDV:                 Fully Diluted Valuation = Total Supply × Price
  Market Cap:          Circulating Supply × Price
  FDV/MCap Ratio:      If > 3x, significant dilution risk from unlocks

SUPPLY SCHEDULE CHECKS:
  - Cliff unlocks: Large token releases on specific dates (bearish events)
  - Vesting schedule: Monthly/quarterly team/investor unlocks
  - Inflation rate: Annual new supply creation (staking rewards, mining)
  - Burn mechanism: Does the protocol burn tokens? (ETH EIP-1559, BNB quarterly burns)
  - Net emission: Inflation rate minus burn rate = actual dilution

RED FLAGS:
  - FDV/MCap > 5x → Massive future dilution
  - Team/VC allocation > 40% → Insider-heavy distribution
  - No cliff passed yet → Selling pressure incoming
  - Unclear or modifiable supply → Governance risk
```

#### Protocol Revenue and Usage
```
REVENUE METRICS (from DeFiLlama / Token Terminal)
  Fees/day:            Total fees generated by the protocol
  Revenue/day:         Fees that accrue to token holders (after expenses)
  P/F Ratio:           FDV / Annualized Fees (like P/S for crypto)
  P/Revenue Ratio:     FDV / Annualized Revenue to token holders

USAGE METRICS
  Daily Active Addresses: Unique wallets interacting with protocol
  Transaction Count:      Daily transactions on the network
  TVL (Total Value Locked): Capital deposited in DeFi protocols
  TVL/MCap Ratio:         If > 1.0, more value locked than market cap (potentially undervalued)

DEVELOPER ACTIVITY (from GitHub / Electric Capital)
  Active developers:    Monthly unique contributors
  Commit frequency:     Code commits per week
  Ecosystem projects:   Number of projects building on the protocol

GROWTH RATES: Calculate 30d, 90d, 180d growth for all metrics above.
Accelerating metrics = bullish; decelerating = bearish.
```

#### Crypto Comparable Analysis
```
L1 BLOCKCHAIN COMPARISON TABLE

Metric          | ETH      | SOL      | AVAX     | Interpretation
----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------------
FDV             | $400B    | $80B     | $15B     | Scale context
Fees/day        | $8M      | $500K    | $100K    | Revenue generation
P/F Ratio       | 137x     | 438x     | 411x     | ETH cheapest on fees
Active Addr/day | 500K     | 1.2M     | 50K      | SOL leads usage
Dev Count       | 2,500    | 1,200    | 400      | ETH leads dev activity
TVL             | $60B     | $8B      | $1.2B    | ETH dominates TVL

DEFI PROTOCOL COMPARISON TABLE

Metric          | AAVE     | MKR      | UNI      | Interpretation
----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------------
FDV             | $2B      | $2.5B    | $6B      | UNI premium
Revenue/day     | $800K    | $500K    | $2M      | UNI leads
P/Revenue       | 6.8x     | 13.7x   | 8.2x    | AAVE cheapest
TVL             | $12B     | $8B      | $5B      | AAVE leads
Token Accrual   | Yes      | Yes      | No       | UNI lacks accrual mechanism
```

### Step 5: Macro Context Analysis

Macro conditions directly affect asset valuations. Assess the current regime:

```
MACRO REGIME CLASSIFICATION

Rate Environment:
  Rising rates    → Negative for growth/tech, positive for banks, negative for crypto
  Stable rates    → Neutral, focus on earnings
  Falling rates   → Positive for growth/tech, positive for crypto, negative for USD

Inflation:
  High (>4%)      → Commodities, energy, TIPS, real assets benefit
  Moderate (2-4%) → Goldilocks for equities
  Low (<2%)       → Growth stocks benefit, deflationary risk

USD Strength:
  Strong USD      → Negative for crypto, negative for international earnings
  Weak USD        → Positive for crypto, positive for commodities, EM equities

Yield Curve:
  Normal (10Y > 2Y)    → Healthy economy, favor cyclicals
  Flat                  → Late cycle, favor defensive
  Inverted (2Y > 10Y)  → Recession signal (12-18 month lead), favor cash and quality
```

#### Sector Rotation Framework

| Economic Phase   | Leading Sectors                              | Lagging Sectors       | Crypto Impact        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Early expansion  | Tech, consumer discretionary, small caps     | Utilities, staples    | Bullish (risk-on)    |
| Mid expansion    | Industrials, materials, financials           | Defensive             | Moderately bullish   |
| Late expansion   | Energy, materials, healthcare                | Tech, growth          | Volatile, selective  |
| Contraction      | Utilities, staples, healthcare, cash         | Cyclicals             | Bearish (risk-off)   |
| Recovery         | Financials, real estate, tech                | Staples               | Strongly bullish     |

---

### Step 6: Earnings Analysis Framework

For publicly traded companies, earnings are the primary valuation driver:

```
EARNINGS ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST

1. BEAT/MISS ANALYSIS
   EPS beat/miss:     Actual EPS vs. consensus estimate (% surprise)
   Revenue beat/miss: Actual revenue vs. consensus
   Whisper number:    Unofficial "real" expectation (often higher than consensus)

   Strong beat:  EPS >5% above consensus AND revenue beat
   Weak beat:    EPS beat but revenue miss (accounting-driven, less bullish)
   Quality miss: Revenue miss but strong guidance (forward-looking)
   Bad miss:     Both miss with lowered guidance (bearish)

2. REVENUE QUALITY
   Organic growth rate: Revenue growth excluding acquisitions
   Recurring revenue %: SaaS → ARR/MRR growth, retention rates
   Customer growth:     Net new customers or subscriber adds
   ARPU trend:          Revenue per user — expanding or contracting?
   Geographic mix:      Diversified or concentrated?

3. MARGIN ANALYSIS
   Gross margin trend:   Expanding → pricing power; Contracting → cost pressure
   Operating margin:     Improving → operational leverage; Declining → SGA bloat
   FCF margin:           Cash generation relative to revenue

4. GUIDANCE IMPACT
   Raised guidance:     Management confident → bullish signal
   Maintained guidance: Neutral (market expects raises after beats)
   Lowered guidance:    Management cautious → bearish signal
   Withdrawn guidance:  Extreme uncertainty (rare, very bearish)

5. POST-EARNINGS FRAMEWORK
   Strong fundamentals + sell-off → Buy opportunity (market overreaction)
   Weak fundamentals + rally      → Be cautious (sugar high, consider selling)
   Strong + strong rally          → Momentum intact, hold/add
   Weak + sell-off                → Correct reaction, avoid catching the knife
```

---

### Step 7: Synthesize the Valuation Verdict

Combine all analyses into a final assessment:

```
VALUATION VERDICT FORMAT

Asset: [Name]
Current Price: [Price]
Asset Type: [Equity growth / equity value / L1 blockchain / DeFi protocol / etc.]

VALUATION SUMMARY
  DCF Fair Value:         $X (margin of safety: Y%)
  Relative Valuation:     P/E at Zx vs sector median of Wx
  Comparable Ranking:     #N out of M peers
  Crypto Metrics:         P/F ratio at Xx vs category median of Yx (if applicable)

FUNDAMENTAL SCORE: [1-10]
  Revenue/usage growth:    [1-10]
  Profitability/cash flow: [1-10]
  Competitive position:    [1-10]
  Macro alignment:         [1-10]
  Tokenomics quality:      [1-10] (crypto only)

VERDICT: [UNDERVALUED / FAIRLY VALUED / OVERVALUED]
CONFIDENCE: [LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH]
CATALYST TIMELINE: [Near-term / Medium-term / Long-term]

TARGET RANGE: $X - $Y (base case - bull case)

KEY RISKS:
  1. [Risk 1]
  2. [Risk 2]
  3. [Risk 3]
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

DO NOT do these — they are common fundamental analysis mistakes:

**Single-metric valuation**: Never value an asset using only P/E or only one ratio. Always triangulate with at least 3 methods (e.g., P/E + EV/EBITDA + DCF, or P/F + TVL analysis + dev activity).

**Ignoring macro context**: A stock can be "cheap" on fundamentals and still fall 40% in a bear market. Always layer macro analysis on top of individual asset analysis.

**Stale data**: Financial data goes stale quickly. Always verify the date of the most recent earnings report and check for any material events since then.

**FDV blindness in crypto**: Comparing market caps without considering fully diluted valuation leads to massively overvaluing tokens with upcoming unlocks.

**Confusing revenue with token price**: Protocol revenue going up does not automatically mean the token should go up — only if that revenue accrues to token holders.

**Terminal growth rate > 3%**: In a DCF, terminal growth above long-term GDP growth is economically impossible at scale. This is the most common DCF manipulation.

**Anchoring to analyst targets**: Analyst price targets cluster around current price and adjust slowly. They are lagging indicators, not leading ones.

**Applying equity frameworks to meme tokens**: Meme coins and community tokens have no cash flows, no revenue, and no traditional fundamentals. Do not attempt to calculate P/E or DCF for DOGE.

## Example

**User**: "Run fundamental analysis on AAVE token"

**Analysis**:

```
## Fundamental Analysis: AAVE

### Asset Classification
- Type: DeFi Protocol (lending/borrowing)
- Category: Blue-chip DeFi
- Comparable peers: MKR (MakerDAO), COMP (Compound)

### Tokenomics
- Circulating Supply: 14.9M AAVE
- Total Supply: 16M AAVE (93% circulating — minimal dilution risk)
- FDV/MCap Ratio: 1.07x (excellent — nearly fully diluted)
- Safety Module: 3.5M AAVE staked (23% of supply locked)
- Token utility: Governance + fee discount + Safety Module staking rewards

### Protocol Metrics
- TVL: $12.2B (largest lending protocol)
- Revenue/day: $820K (annualized: $299M)
- Fees/day: $1.4M (annualized: $511M)
- P/F Ratio: FDV $2.1B / $511M fees = 4.1x
- P/Revenue: FDV $2.1B / $299M revenue = 7.0x
- Active markets: 8 chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Base, BSC, Metis)

### Comparable Analysis
| Metric        | AAVE     | MKR      | COMP     |
|---------------|----------|----------|----------|
| FDV           | $2.1B    | $2.5B    | $450M    |
| TVL           | $12.2B   | $8.0B    | $2.1B    |
| P/F Ratio     | 4.1x     | 13.7x   | 8.5x    |
| P/Revenue     | 7.0x     | 15.2x   | 14.1x   |
| Multi-chain   | 8 chains | 5 chains | 4 chains |
| Revenue trend | +45% QoQ | +20% QoQ| -5% QoQ |

AAVE is the cheapest on both P/F and P/Revenue among lending peers,
while leading on TVL, multi-chain deployment, and revenue growth.

### Macro Alignment
- Current regime: Moderate rates, crypto market in expansion phase
- DeFi lending benefits from: higher rates (lending yields attract capital), growing on-chain activity
- Risk factor: regulatory uncertainty around DeFi lending protocols

### Fundamental Score: 8/10
- Revenue/usage growth:    9/10 (strong QoQ acceleration)
- Profitability:           8/10 (protocol is profitable, revenue accrues partially to stakers)
- Competitive position:    9/10 (market leader in DeFi lending by TVL)
- Macro alignment:         7/10 (favorable but regulatory risk)
- Tokenomics quality:      8/10 (low dilution, staking lock-up, governance utility)

### Verdict: UNDERVALUED
Confidence: HIGH
Catalyst: Protocol fee switch expansion + multi-chain TVL growth

Target range: $180 - $240 (current: $140)
Upside: 28% - 71% based on peer re-rating to average P/F

### Key Risks
1. Regulatory action against DeFi lending protocols (SEC classification risk)
2. Smart contract exploit on any deployed chain (historical: flash loan attacks)
3. Competitor protocols offering higher yields or better UX pulling TVL

### Next Step
--> Pass to risk-management for position sizing and stop-loss placement
--> Use technical-analysis for optimal entry timing
